👋 **Welcome to My LLM Engineering Portfolio**

Hi, I'm Koh Chong Ming, a transaction banking product expert and LLM engineering enthusiast exploring how AI can power the next generation of intelligent financial systems.

This repository showcases my journey in large language model (LLM) engineering, including my personal projects. My focus is on applying these technologies to solve real-world challenges in payments automation, cash management and corporate treasury.

**My Approach**

Every project here is guided by one question: “How can LLMs make human work smarter, faster, and more insightful?” You’ll find experiments that blend **AI reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic workflows, and synthetic data generation** which I want to master and apply to payments, corporate treasury and transaction banking.

🚀 **Featured Themes**

🧠 **LLM Workflows & Agents:** experimenting with LangChain, and custom tool-calling frameworks

🔍 **Vectorized RAG Pipelines:** building scalable retrieval systems using embeddings, Chroma/FAISS, vectorizing and retireval with cloud host LLM or local LLM (like Llama CPP and Ollama) for privacy

🧩 **Synthetic Data Generation:** creating realistic datasets for payments, treasury, and automation testing
